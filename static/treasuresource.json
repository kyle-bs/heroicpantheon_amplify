Heroes emerged who rallied the common folk together against the threat from the Inner Planes. What is not known is how it fell.

It's underground, you see - and what's left of the city and it's inhabitants is unknown! Perhaps you can find the final resting place of it's founder, or what remains of the touch of the Inner Planes and the Abyss!
